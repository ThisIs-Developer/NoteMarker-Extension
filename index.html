                <p><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>
                <p>This Privacy Policy outlines the practices employed by NoteMarker regarding the collection, use, and protection of user information.

                <h3>3. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h3>
                <p>The Browser Extension is licensed, not sold. You acknowledge that Baivab Sarkar and its licensors own all rights, title, and interest, including without limitation all intellectual property rights, in and to the Browser Extension, portions thereof, or software provided through or in conjunction with the Browser Extension.

                <p>Baivab Sarkar provides the Browser Extension "as is" without any warranties. We disclaim all express, implied, and statutory warranties, including those of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement.

                <p>While Baivab Sarkar disclaims all warranties, you are still entitled to the benefits of any applicable statutory rights under your jurisdiction, including but not limited to data protection laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).</p>

                <p>Some jurisdictions may not allow exclusions of implied warranties, so these limitations may not apply to you.</p>

                <h3>5. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
                <p>Baivab Sarkar and its licensors are not liable for any damages resulting from your use or misuse of the Browser Extension. This limitation applies to indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, and punitive damages, regardless of the basis of the claim (e.g., warranty, contract, tort). It includes damages arising from reliance on, inability to use, or interruptions of the Browser Extension, even if advised of the possibility of such damages. Some jurisdictions do not allow such exclusions, so these limitations may not apply to you.</p>

                <p>Baivab Sarkar's total liability under this License shall not exceed any amounts you have paid for the Browser Extension. Baivab Sarkar shall not be responsible for any third-party claims or damages that result from the use of the Browser Extension in conjunction with third-party services, websites, or software.</p>

                <h3>6. INDEMNIFICATION</h3>

This indemnification obligation applies regardless of whether Baivab Sarkar exercised control over or approved of your actions giving rise to the claim.</p>

                <p>Baivab Sarkar reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, but doing so shall not excuse your indemnity obligations.</p>

                <h3>7. TERM AND TERMINATION</h3>
                <p>This Browser Extension License and the licenses granted hereunder are effective on the date you accept the terms of this Browser Extension License or use the Browser Extension and shall continue until terminated by either party pursuant to this section.
